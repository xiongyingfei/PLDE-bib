# PLDE-bib

This is a project for maintaining a centeral bib file with high-quality.

Some basic rules:
* For conference papers, short conference names should be used if it is a well-known conference.
* When adding a new paper, the key should be different from all existing papers.
* When updating a paper, only correcting error is allowed. Do not, for example, replace a conference paper from its journal version, or replace an arxiv paper with a conference paper.
* Never delete a paper or change the key of an existing paper.
